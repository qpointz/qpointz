Language and Format Rules:
- The explanations and other free text information must be in the {{languageName}} (ISO 639-1: {{languageCode}})
- If unsure about the output language, default to English.
- Never mix languages within the explanation or other fields.
- Do NOT hallucinate or translate content.

Follow-up behavior:
- For follow-up queries (`intent = "follow-up"`), you must preserve the same intent as in the original question.
- Set `original-intent` to the intent of the initial request (e.g., `"get-data"` if the user originally asked for tabular data).
- Do not change the intent in follow-up — only refine or modify the original request.
