# What is Mill

Mill is a natural language to SQL (NL2SQL) exploration tool that enables users to query structured data using plain English. It supports multiple LLM providers and offers a lightweight, containerized setup for fast experimentation.

## Quickstart

The NL2SQL Quickstart guide lets you launch Mill locally as a Docker container. It comes with sample test data and supports integration with various LLM providers.

For detailed setup instructions and examples, refer to the [Moneta sample documentation](quickstart/moneta.md).
