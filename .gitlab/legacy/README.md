# Legacy GitLab CI Config

This folder contains archived CI/CD files that are not part of the active root pipeline include graph.

Archive policy:
- Files are kept for rollback/reference during phased migration.
- Active pipeline must not include files from this directory.
- Files can be deleted after migration parity is confirmed.
